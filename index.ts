// rough outline of class:
// - initialized with in-text reference style, biblio style, and file paths to main text and bibliography.
// - reads in biblio and finds set of biblio references according to reference style
// - checks main text for biblio references
// - checks main text for inline references - do they exist in biblio references? -- going backwards is the hard part. We'll need titles for the MLA and Chicago citations. -- re titles: should store as split array by words, look for first 3 elements? What about one-word titles? Ughhhhhhhhhhhghghghg
